# Semi-Parametric-Copula-Approach
This repository contains all of the MATLAB code required to run the Semi-Parametric approach to moment independent 
global sensitivity analysis developed in Manheim and Detwiler (2019). In addition, the code developed to compare non-parametric
approaches to moment independent, global sensitivity are also included in this repository. The code developed for comparison in Manheim and Detwiler (2019) corresponds to the following studies:

To run any of the codes, simply download the folders and place them on MATLAB's current path. The matlab files "run_" are the scripts that should be run, where the results are automatically saved after execution. Please email Derek Manheim (dmanheim@uci.edu) if any issues are encountered.
